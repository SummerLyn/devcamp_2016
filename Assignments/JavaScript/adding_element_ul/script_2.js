// Create the following program
// Ask the user if they want to create an ordered or unordered list for their favorite foods.

// Then create the html element dynamically by asking for their five favorite foods and add them to the list.


//STEP 2 create an array in your javascript file that has five of your favorite foods.
// redo your program so if the user enters a food that is also on your favorite food list then make the font color green
// if it is not on your list make the font color red


var myFavoriteFoodList = ["bananas", "apples", "pie", "tacos", "crumpets"];
